# Introducing MAGIC

MAGIC is a non-inflationary cryptocurrency designed for stable DeFi.

# Initial Distribution

The MAGIC team is kickstarting the initial distribution with a liquidity event. Contribute ETH to the MAGIC liquidity generation event smart contract to receive tokens, and the contributed ETH will be matched and added to the Uniswap liquidity pool. Note that once added, liquidity tokens can not be removed from the MAGIC Uniswap LP pools. This is by design. Read on to learn about why..

# **Deflationary Farming**

Farming tokens have a problem for their owners. To keep users farming, they have to mint more ever more coins. This completely destroys the value of the underlying token, due to excessive inflation. It's easy to find examples of this across the DeFi ecosystem.

Our solution is called deflationary farming, and it is quite simple in only two steps:

1. Charge a fee on token transfers
2. Users can earn the fee by farming

This simple process means that those holding tokens are able to farm without infinite inflation.

# **10000 MAGIC Forever**

Theres absolutely no way to create new MAGIC tokens. This means the circulating supply can only ever go down, period.
